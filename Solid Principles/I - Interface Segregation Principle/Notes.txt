
- We use serveral interfaces or abstract classes in order to achieve abstraction.

- sometimes we want to implement a given interface but just for the sake of methods defined by that inteface
- we can end up with fat interfaces - containing more methods than the actual class needs. 

"Software modules (classes and methods) should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use"


What does it mean 
-----------------------
- it is not good if an interface has a large number of methods
- we should seperate the methods accordingly 

"In Java a given class may implement as many interfaces as we want (!!!). 

- no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. 
- when it is possible we should break our interfaces in many smaller ones so they better satisfy the exact needs of our clients.
