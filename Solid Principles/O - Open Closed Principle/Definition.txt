O - Open / Closed Principle
-----------------------------
- what is the motivation behind solid priciples?

  * unfortunetely during software development there will be several changes and updates!!!

- an application should take care of the frequent changes that are done during the development and the maintaince phases. 

- for example adding new features. 

---------------------------
- changes in the existing code should be minimized
- it's assumed that the exisiting code is already united tested. 
- and changes in already written code might affect the the existing functionaility in an unwanted manner. 

Cycle 
Implementing Classes and Modules <--------------------------> testing the modules. (unit tests)

Definition: 

Open Closed Principle states that the design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionailty 
should be added with minimum changes in the exisiting code. We should keep as much existing code unchanged as possible. 


Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. 

There are 2 important design patterns that can guarantee that the open closed principle is not violated: 

        1) Strategy Pattern 

        2) Template Pattern 

Abstract Date Type Defines the behaviour without the implementation.
