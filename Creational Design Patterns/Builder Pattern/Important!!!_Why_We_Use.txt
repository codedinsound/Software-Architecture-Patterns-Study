----------------------------------------

- there would be lots of paremeters in the constructor ~ hard to follow 
- Hard not to confuse parameters !!! 
      - setters are the same, not the best solution 
  

- not exstensible: when we have to add one more optional parameters, we have to create 
  a new constructor Telescoping constructors appear!!!
  with a builder ----> we just add another method 

- immutable property: we should consider parallel execution 
  the best is to use objects that can not be modified after they have been created. 
  "immutable objects"
  - so there will not be any problems because of concurrent updates by multiple threads.
