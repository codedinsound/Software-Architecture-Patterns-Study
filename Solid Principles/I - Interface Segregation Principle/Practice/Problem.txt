In the previous lectures we have considered the Interface Segregation Principle. We've seen how to eliminate fat interfaces with multiple interfaces.

Let's solve the following problem - we have a fat interface like this:

public interface Employee {
	// CEO + managers + workers
	public void salary();
	// managers
	public void hire();
	public void train();
	// CEO + managers
	public void addBonus();
	// CEO
	public void makeDecisions();	
	public void addStocks();
}
... and of course we have 3 classes - Worker, Manager and CEO. Let's split the fat interface into several interfaces and make sure the SOLID principle are not violated.

Good luck!
