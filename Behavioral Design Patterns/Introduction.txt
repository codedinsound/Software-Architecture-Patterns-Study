The next lectures are about behavioral design patterns. We will consider the following design pattern one by one:

strategy pattern

observer pattern

command pattern

template pattern

visitor pattern

null object and the iterator patterns

"In software engineering behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects. These patterns increase flexibility in carrying out the communication."
